Project Overview: The Book Library Application aims to provide a user-friendly platform 
where book lovers can search, organize, and track books theyâ€™re reading or plan to read. This 
app allows users to search for books, create and manage reading lists, mark favorites, track 
reading progress, and receive tailored book recommendations. By integrating with the Google 
Books API, the application will also offer comprehensive book details and purchasing/borrowing 
options.
